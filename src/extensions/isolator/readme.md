# Isolator
The component isolator manages networks of capsules, which are isolated component environments.

## Entities

### Capsule
Bit implements a filesystem capsule, which is an isolated folder containing the component files.
Capsules include the component files and links to other capsules that include the component's dependencies.

### Network
A network is a group of capsules, related to one another by their dependencies.
A network includes a graph of all seed components given to it, as well as a list of the capsules.

Example:
```javascript
const Network = {
  graph: Graph,
  capsules: CapsuleList
}
```
