# Paper
Paper is an extension for building modern terminal commands using React components.
It uses [Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) and [commander](https://github.com/tj/commander.js/) behind the scences to deliver a unified experience for building amazing component-based CLI apps.

## Features
- Allow to register new commands
- Use commander commands.
- Render to stdout with Ink.
- move to new command definition format (see example at `run.cmd.tx`)
