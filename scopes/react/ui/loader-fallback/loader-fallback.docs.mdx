import { LoaderFallback } from './loader-fallback';

Renders a component, and show a placeholder when it is undefined.

Logic is as follows:

1. when component is defined -> render it
1. when the initial value of the component is undefined -> show the default immediately
1. when the component had just changed to be undefined -> show Loader for _x_ seconds
   1. then, after _x_ seconds - show NotFound

<!-- live playground doesn't keep state when editing :( -->
<!-- Try it out:

```tsx live
function Example() {
  return (
    <LoaderFallback
      Target={RegularComponent} // comment this out
      DefaultComponent={Fallback}
      timeout={2000}
    />
  );

  function RegularComponent() {
    return <div>regular component</div>;
  }

  function Fallback() {
    return <div>this shows when component is undefined</div>;
  }
}
``` -->
