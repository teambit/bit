# Bit CLI MCP Server

The Bit CLI MCP Server provides a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcp) interface to Bit's command-line functionality. It acts as a bridge between MCP clients (such as VS Code, AI tools, or your own applications) and the Bit CLI, enabling programmatic access to Bit workspace and component management operations.

## Setup

### Installation

The Bit CLI MCP Server is included with Bit. To set it up with your IDE, run:

```bash
# Basic setup for VS Code (default)
bit mcp-server setup

# Other supported editors
bit mcp-server setup [vscode|cursor|windsurf|roo|cline|claude-code]
```

#### Recommended Setup Steps

After installation, consider these helpful setup steps:

1. **For new workspaces**: Set your default scope so the search tool knows which remote scope to search:
   ```bash
   bit scope set <your-remote-scope>
   ```

2. **Generate rules/instructions** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   bit mcp-server rules
   ```
   This provides the AI agent with comprehensive guidance about Bit and MCP server functionality.

3. **VS Code users**: Make sure to select "agent" mode instead of "ask" mode in the chat interface. For first-time users, open the command palette and search for "MCP: List servers" to find and start the Bit server.

### Configuration Options

- `--global`: Apply configuration globally (user settings) instead of workspace settings
- `--consumer-project`: Configure for consumer projects that only consume Bit components
- `--include-additional <commands>`: Add specific commands to the available tools (comma-separated list)

## Usage

### Running the Server

To manually start the server:

```bash
bit mcp-server start [options]
```

Options:
- `--consumer-project`: For non-Bit workspaces that only consume Bit component packages
- `--include-additional <commands>`: Add specific commands to the available tools (comma-separated list)

### Generating AI Rules

Create instruction files for AI assistants:

```bash
bit mcp-server rules [vscode|cursor|windsurf|roo|cline|claude-code] [options]
```

Options:
- `--global`: Write rules to global configuration
- `--consumer-project`: Generate rules for consumer projects
- `--print`: Print rules content to screen


## Available Tools

The Bit CLI MCP Server operates in two modes and provides several specialized tools:

### Default Mode

In default mode, the server exposes a minimal set of essential tools focused on core functionality:

- `bit_remote_search`: Search for components in remote scopes
- `bit_workspace_info`: Get comprehensive workspace information including status, components list, apps, templates, and dependency graph
- `bit_component_details`: Get detailed information about multiple components in parallel (up to 5 max) including basic info and optionally their public API schemas
- `bit_create`: Create a new component (source files and config) using a template with proper argument validation and documentation
- `bit_query`: Execute read-only Bit commands that safely inspect workspace and component state without making modifications
- `bit_execute`: Execute any Bit command, including those that modify workspace or repository state (use with caution)
- `bit_commands_list`: Get all available Bit commands with descriptions and groups (for command discovery)
- `bit_command_help`: Get detailed help for a specific Bit command including syntax, arguments, flags, and usage examples

> **Command Discovery vs. Command Help**: Use `bit_commands_list` to discover what commands are available in Bit, then use `bit_command_help` with a specific command name to get detailed usage information including arguments, flags, and examples.

### Consumer Project Mode (--consumer-project)

This mode is designed for applications or projects that are not Bit workspaces but need to consume or work with Bit components as packages. It provides a minimal set of tools focused on component discovery and information:

- `bit_remote_search`: Search for components in remote scopes
- `bit_remote_component_details`: Get detailed information about a remote component including basic info and its public API schema (combines the functionality of show and schema commands)

In this mode:

1. You don't need a Bit workspace initialization
2. Only these 2 tools are available (no workspace-specific tools)
3. The `--remote` flag is automatically added to component detail queries
4. The `cwd` parameter is still required but can be any directory (not necessarily a Bit workspace)
5. You can still add additional tools with the `--include-additional` flag
