# Bit CLI MCP Server

The Bit CLI MCP Server provides a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcp) interface to Bit's command-line functionality, enabling programmatic access to Bit workspace and component management operations. This server exposes Bit CLI commands as MCP tools, making it possible to automate, script, or integrate Bit operations with other tools and platforms.

## Overview

This server acts as a bridge between MCP clients (such as VS Code, AI tools, or your own applications) and the Bit CLI. It leverages the Bit server API for efficient communication and provides both individual CLI command tools and specialized composite tools for common workflows. The server automatically manages a Bit server instance in the background for optimal performance.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
- Bit CLI installed and available in your PATH

### Getting Started

The Bit CLI MCP Server is included with Bit. If you have Bit installed, you can run the server using:

```
bit mcp-server start
```

## Usage

### Command-Line Options

```
bit mcp-server start [options]
```

Options:

- `--consumer-project`: For non-Bit workspaces that only consume Bit component packages. Enables only "bit_remote_search" and "bit_remote_component_details" tools and automatically adds the "--remote" flag to relevant commands.
- `--include-additional <commands>`: Add specific commands to the available tools (comma-separated list)

### Integrating with IDEs

The easiest way to integrate the MCP server with your IDE is to use the `setup` command:

```bash
# Basic setup for VS Code (default)
bit mcp-server setup
```

This will automatically configure your VS Code settings to use the Bit MCP server. See the [Automatic Setup](#automatic-integration-setup) section below for more options.

### Automatic Integration Setup

The **recommended way** to integrate the MCP server with your IDE is using the `setup` command:

```bash
bit mcp-server setup [vscode|cursor|windsurf] [options]
```

This command automatically configures the MCP server settings in your chosen editor. If no editor is specified, it defaults to VS Code.

#### Supported Editors

- **VS Code**: `bit mcp-server setup vscode` (or just `bit mcp-server setup`)
- **Cursor**: `bit mcp-server setup cursor`
- **Windsurf**: `bit mcp-server setup windsurf`

#### Configuration Options

- `--global`: Apply configuration globally (user settings) instead of workspace settings
- `--consumer-project`: Configure for consumer projects
- `--include-additional <commands>`: Add specific commands to the available tools

#### Examples

```bash
# Basic VS Code setup (workspace level)
bit mcp-server setup

# Global setup for Cursor
bit mcp-server setup cursor --global

# Setup with consumer project mode
bit mcp-server setup --consumer-project
```

#### Manual Configuration

If you need to manually configure the settings, here's a basic example for VS Code:

1. Open VS Code settings (JSON) by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` (or `Cmd + Shift + P` on macOS) and typing `Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)`
2. Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "bit-cli": {
        "command": "bit",
        "args": ["mcp-server", "start"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Programmatic Usage

```javascript
import { McpClient } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client';

async function example() {
  const client = await McpClient.spawn('bit', ['mcp-server', 'start']);

  // Call a Bit CLI tool via MCP
  const result = await client.callTool('bit_status', { cwd: '/path/to/workspace' });
  console.log(result.content[0].text);

  // Close the connection when done
  await client.close();
}
```

## Available Tools

The Bit CLI MCP Server operates in two modes and provides several specialized tools:

### Default Mode

In default mode, the server exposes a minimal set of essential tools focused on core functionality. This ensures optimal performance and safety:

- **Always Available Tools:**

  - `bit_remote_search`: Search for components in remote scopes
  - `bit_workspace_info`: Get comprehensive workspace information including status, components list, apps, templates, and dependency graph
  - `bit_component_details`: Get detailed information about a specific component including basic info and optionally its public API schema
  - `bit_query`: Execute read-only Bit commands that safely inspect workspace and component state without making modifications
  - `bit_execute`: Execute any Bit command, including those that modify workspace or repository state (use with caution)
  - `bit_commands_list`: Get all available Bit commands with descriptions and groups (for command discovery)
  - `bit_command_help`: Get detailed help for a specific Bit command including syntax, arguments, flags, and usage examples

> **Command Discovery vs. Command Help**: Use `bit_commands_list` to discover what commands are available in Bit, then use `bit_command_help` with a specific command name to get detailed usage information including arguments, flags, and examples.

### Consumer Project Mode (--consumer-project)

This mode is designed for applications or projects that are not Bit workspaces but need to consume or work with Bit components as packages. It provides a minimal set of tools focused on component discovery and information:

- `bit_remote_search`: Search for components in remote scopes
- `bit_remote_component_details`: Get detailed information about a remote component including basic info and its public API schema (combines the functionality of show and schema commands)

In this mode:

1. You don't need a Bit workspace initialization
2. Only these 2 tools are available (no workspace-specific tools)
3. The `--remote` flag is automatically added to component detail queries
4. The `cwd` parameter is still required but can be any directory (not necessarily a Bit workspace)
5. You can still add additional tools with the `--include-additional` flag

## Tool Parameters

All tools accept a `cwd` parameter specifying the workspace path. Additional parameters vary by command.

Example tool call for `bit_status`:

```json
{
  "cwd": "/path/to/workspace",
  "warnings": true,
  "json": true
}
```

## Custom Tool Selection

To customize the available tools:

```
# Add specific tools to the available tools
bit mcp-server start --include-additional "build,lint,format,create,schema"

# For consumer projects (non-Bit workspaces)
bit mcp-server start --consumer-project

# Add specific tools to the consumer project set
bit mcp-server start --consumer-project --include-additional "deps,get,preview"
```

### Writing AI Assistant Rules

The MCP server provides a `rules` command to create instruction files for AI assistants:

```bash
bit mcp-server rules [vscode|cursor|windsurf|cline] [options]
```

This command creates rules/instructions markdown files that provide guidance to AI assistants on how to effectively use the Bit MCP server and follow best practices when working with Bit components.

#### Supported Editors

- **VS Code**: `bit mcp-server rules vscode` (or just `bit mcp-server rules`)
- **Cursor**: `bit mcp-server rules cursor`
- **Windsurf**: `bit mcp-server rules windsurf`
- **Cline**: `bit mcp-server rules cline`

#### Configuration Options

- `--global`: Write rules to global configuration (default: workspace-specific)
- `--print`: Print rules content to screen instead of writing to file
- `--consumer-project`: Generate rules for consumer projects that only use Bit components as packages

#### Examples

```bash
# Basic VS Code rules (workspace level)
bit mcp-server rules

# Global rules for Cursor
bit mcp-server rules cursor --global

# Consumer project rules for VS Code
bit mcp-server rules --consumer-project

# Global rules for Cline (macOS only)
bit mcp-server rules cline --global

# Workspace-specific rules for Cline
bit mcp-server rules cline

# Print rules content to screen for manual setup
bit mcp-server rules --print

# Print consumer project content for Windsurf (requires manual addition to .windsurfrules)
bit mcp-server rules windsurf --print --consumer-project
```
