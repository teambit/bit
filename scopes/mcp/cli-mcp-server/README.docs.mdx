# Bit CLI MCP Server

The Bit CLI MCP Server provides a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcp) interface to Bit's command-line functionality, enabling programmatic access to Bit workspace and component management operations. This server exposes Bit CLI commands as MCP tools, making it possible to automate, script, or integrate Bit operations with other tools and platforms.

## Overview

This server acts as a bridge between MCP clients (such as VS Code, AI tools, or your own applications) and the Bit CLI. It leverages the Bit server API for efficient communication and provides both individual CLI command tools and specialized composite tools for common workflows. The server automatically manages a Bit server instance in the background for optimal performance.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
- Bit CLI installed and available in your PATH

### Getting Started

The Bit CLI MCP Server is included with Bit. If you have Bit installed, you can run the server using:

```
bit mcp-server
```

## Usage

### Command-Line Options

```
bit mcp-server [options]
```

Options:

- `-e, --extended`: Enable the full set of Bit CLI commands as MCP tools
- `--consumer-project`: For non-Bit workspaces that only consume Bit component packages. Enables only "schema", "show", and "remote-search" tools and automatically adds the "--remote" flag to relevant commands.
- `--include-only <commands>`: Specify a subset of commands to expose as MCP tools (comma-separated list)
- `--include-additional <commands>`: Add specific commands to the default set (comma-separated list)
- `--exclude <commands>`: Prevent specific commands from being exposed (comma-separated list)

### Integrating with IDEs

The easiest way to integrate the MCP server with your IDE is to use the `setup` command:

```bash
# Basic setup for VS Code (default)
bit mcp-server setup
```

This will automatically configure your VS Code settings to use the Bit MCP server. See the [Automatic Setup](#automatic-integration-setup) section below for more options.

### Automatic Integration Setup

The **recommended way** to integrate the MCP server with your IDE is using the `setup` command:

```bash
bit mcp-server setup [vscode|cursor|windsurf] [options]
```

This command automatically configures the MCP server settings in your chosen editor. If no editor is specified, it defaults to VS Code.

#### Supported Editors

- **VS Code**: `bit mcp-server setup vscode` (or just `bit mcp-server setup`)
- **Cursor**: `bit mcp-server setup cursor`
- **Windsurf**: `bit mcp-server setup windsurf`

#### Configuration Options

- `--global`: Apply configuration globally (user settings) instead of workspace settings
- `--extended`: Configure with extended mode enabled
- `--consumer-project`: Configure for consumer projects
- `--include-only <commands>`: Specify subset of commands to expose
- `--include-additional <commands>`: Add specific commands to the default set
- `--exclude <commands>`: Prevent specific commands from being exposed

#### Examples

```bash
# Basic VS Code setup (workspace level)
bit mcp-server setup

# Global setup for Cursor with extended mode
bit mcp-server setup cursor --global --extended

# Setup for Windsurf with consumer project mode
bit mcp-server setup windsurf --consumer-project
```

#### Manual Configuration

If you need to manually configure the settings, here's a basic example for VS Code:

1. Open VS Code settings (JSON) by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` (or `Cmd + Shift + P` on macOS) and typing `Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)`
2. Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "bit-cli": {
        "command": "bit",
        "args": ["mcp-server"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Programmatic Usage

```javascript
import { McpClient } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client';

async function example() {
  const client = await McpClient.spawn('bit', ['mcp-server']);

  // Call a Bit CLI tool via MCP
  const result = await client.callTool('bit_status', { cwd: '/path/to/workspace' });
  console.log(result.content[0].text);

  // Close the connection when done
  await client.close();
}
```

## Available Tools

The Bit CLI MCP Server operates in three modes and provides several specialized tools:

### Default Mode

In default mode, the server exposes a minimal set of essential tools focused on component discovery and creation. This ensures optimal performance and safety:

- **Individual CLI Command Tools:**

  - `bit_create`: Generate components from templates
  - `bit_schema`: Retrieve component API schema from workspace or remote scopes
  - `bit_remote_search`: Search for components in remote scopes

- **Specialized Composite Tools:**

  - `bit_workspace_info`: Get comprehensive workspace information including status, components list, apps, templates, and dependency graph
  - `bit_component_details`: Get detailed information about a specific component including basic info and optionally its public API schema
  - `bit_commands_info`: Get information about available Bit commands and their groups

- **Generic Execution Tools:**
  - `bit_query`: Execute read-only Bit commands that safely inspect workspace and component state without making modifications
  - `bit_execute`: Execute any Bit command, including those that modify workspace or repository state (use with caution)

### Consumer Project Mode (--consumer-project)

This mode is designed for applications or projects that are not Bit workspaces but need to consume or work with Bit components as packages. It provides a minimal set of tools focused on component discovery and information:

- `bit_schema`: Retrieves component API schema from remote scopes (automatically adds `--remote` flag)
- `bit_show`: Displays component information from remote scopes (automatically adds `--remote` flag)
- `bit_remote_search`: Searches for components in remote scopes

In this mode:

1. You don't need a Bit workspace initialization
2. The `--remote` flag is automatically added to `show` and `schema` commands
3. The `cwd` parameter is still required but can be any directory (not necessarily a Bit workspace)
4. You can still add additional tools with the `--include-additional` flag

### Extended Mode (--extended)

When started with the `--extended` flag, the server exposes nearly all Bit CLI commands as MCP tools, including:

- All lane sub-commands (remove, alias, rename, diff, change-scope, import, fetch, eject, history, etc.)
- Development tools (build, lint, format)
- Package management (uninstall, update)
- Component operations (recover, fork, rename)
- Workspace management (ws-config, stash, aspect)
- Analysis tools (insight, deps, why)
- And many more

> **Note:** When using extended mode, some AI models (particularly Gemini and ChatGPT) may struggle with the high number of available tools and respond with "400 Bad Request" or "500 Server Error" errors. This is not due to any issue with specific tools, but rather with how these models handle large tool sets. Claude Sonnet tends to handle extended mode better. If you encounter these errors, try using default mode or selectively adding only the tools you need via the `--include-additional` flag.

## Tool Parameters

All tools accept a `cwd` parameter specifying the workspace path. Additional parameters vary by command.

Example tool call for `bit_status`:

```json
{
  "cwd": "/path/to/workspace",
  "warnings": true,
  "json": true
}
```

## Custom Tool Selection

To customize the available tools beyond the default set or extended mode:

```
# Include only specific tools
bit mcp-server --include-only "status,show,tag,snap,import,export"

# Add specific tools to the default set
bit mcp-server --include-additional "build,lint,format"

# For consumer projects (non-Bit workspaces)
bit mcp-server --consumer-project

# Add specific tools to the consumer project set
bit mcp-server --consumer-project --include-additional "deps,get,preview"

# Exclude specific tools from being available
bit mcp-server --extended --exclude "checkout,remove"
```
