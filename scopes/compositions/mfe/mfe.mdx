# Building a Micro Frontend architecture with Bit

What is a Micro Frontends? I think this is an open question that many are trying to answer these days.
In my option, Micro Frontends is simply nomurous autonomous teams collaborating on one or more web applications.

## Bit

```js
import { MyComponent } from './my-component'
// if REACT add Import react from 'react'
export const firstComposition = () => {
  return (
    <MyComponent />
  );
```

Debbie is amazing but Gilad is also

Bit is a component-based approach to development and collaboration of modern applications. Bit makes the development and composition of
modern applications from independent components, owned by different autonomous teams, collaborating with each other, easy and repeatable.

## Simple, decoupled codebases

In a micro-service architecture, teams get little and focused codebases which highly ease on-boarding of new developers
and developer productivity.
With Bit, each team can its own dynamic component codebase... which allows them to maintain and own only the components they
are respoinsible for.

- Dynamic workspaces, for a team, or individual.
- Access and change any component from your workspace.
- Reuse any component/API built by any other team.

## Application development

## Component development

## Independent deployments

Every team can independetly release new versions to components, used across all in other applications.

### Run-time dependencies

Solutions like Module Federation and Code Splitting help fetch moduels duriong

### Build-time dependencies

## Autonomous teams

## Cross team collaboration and integration

### Updates

### API Feedbacks

### CI/CD

## Data fetching

## Styling and themeing

## Testing

Each component is testing itself and its dependencies.

## Application performance

## Share components in any level of granularity.

Components can be shared in any level of granularity.

### Presnetation components

### MFE components.

Optimizing deps at runtime.

### Applications.

## Server-side and micro-services
