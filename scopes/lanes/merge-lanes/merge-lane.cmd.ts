to merge the lane from the local scope without updating it first, use "--skip-fetch" flag.

when the current and merge candidate lanes are diverged in history and the files could be merged with no conflicts,
these components will be snap-merged to complete the merge. use "no-auto-snap" to opt-out, or "tag" to tag instead.

when the components are not diverged in history, and the current lane is behind the merge candidate, the merge will
simply update the components and the heads according to the merge candidate.
to opt-out, use "--no-snap", the components will be written as the merge candidate, and will be left as modified.

in case a component in both ends don't share history (no snap is found in common), the merge will require "--resolve-unrelated" flag.
this flag keeps the history of one end and saves a reference to the other end. the decision of which end to keep is determined by the following:
1. if the component exists on main, then the history linked to main will be kept.
in this case, the strategy of "--resolve-unrelated" only determines which source-code to keep. it's not about the history.
2. if the component doesn't exist on main, then by default, the history of the current lane will be kept.
unless "--resolve-unrelated" is set to "theirs", in which case the history of the other lane will be kept.
2. a. an edge case: if the component is deleted on the current lane, the strategy will always be "theirs".
so then the history (and the source-code) of the other lane will be kept.
