See more details about these two features here: [Lanes](https://github.com/teambit/bit/issues/1986). [Snaps](https://github.com/teambit/bit/issues/1985).

The following describes the final implementation, which differs from the specification above.

## Synopsis

```
- create a snap: `bit snap` (synopsis similar to the `bit tag`)
- create a new lane: `bit lane create <name>`
- list lanes: `bit lane list`
- switch between lanes: `bit switch <name>`
- merge lanes: `bit lane merge`
- show lane details: `bit lane show <name>`
- diff between lanes: `bit lane diff <values>`
- track local lane to a remote lane: `bit switch --as`
- remove a lane: `bit lane remove <name>`.
- fetch lane objects (without the components): `bit fetch --lanes`
- import a lane: `bit lane import`
- export current lane: `bit export`
- (internal) cat lane object: `bit cat-lane <name>`
```

## Remaining tasks

- [ ] Remove components from a remote lane.
- [ ] Tag dependencies to include them in a lane.
- [ ] Test bit-fetch components
- [ ] Rename lanes: enable importing a lane after rename.
- [ ] Fix performance issue. Now it fetches all parents every time. It doesn't make sense.
- [ ] Fix performance issue. Now it traverses all parents to see if a hash in there.

## Important points

### Lane ID

The Lane id consists of the lane name and the scope. If this is a new lane, the scope is the defaultScope.
The `LaneId` _always_ has these two props.

### Performance consideration

Currently, if it imports with no-deps, it doesn't ask for parents, if it imports with deps it imports with all parents. It is originated from src/api/scope/lib/fetch.ts: `const collectParents = !noDependencies;`. We need to make a decision here.

### Model changes

- `Version.parents`. This is added only if the lanes feature is enabled. (it doesn't change the hash).
- `Component.head` This is added only if the lanes feature is enabled. (it doesn't change the hash).

### Hash

- Snap's hash is generated by a UUID and then converted into sha1. `sha1(v4())`.
- Lane's hash is generated by a UUID and then converted into sha1. `sha1(v4())`.
- Tag's hash stays the same. Generated by the `Version.id()`.
- Lane's hash doesn't get changed even if the lane has been renamed or its scope changed.

### Lane Data

Lane data, for the most cases is a map of component-id:snap-head, in other words, it saves per component the head snap. There are 3 different places where we store such data for different purposes.

- `lane-object` "Lane" is saved in the scope `.bit/objects` (.bit can be .git/bit locally), it has a unique hash and contains a map of components and their heads. This object exists on both local and remote scopes. Its main purpose is to sync lane-data between scopes. See `Lane` class (in scope/model) for the implementation details.
- `workspace-lane` (component and their versions) is saved in `.bit/workspace/lanes/lane-name`. Remote scopes don't have this data. Its main purpose is to store data that exists only locally and does not exist on the remote. See `WorkspaceLane` class for the implementation details. Without this, when a user is on a lane and check out to another snap, we can't save this checked out snap, because .bitmap has only main version and `Lane` object has only the heads.
- `remote-lane` (component and their heads) is saved in `.bit/refs/remote/remote-name/lane-name`. These refs files are saved in both, local and remote scopes. Its main purpose is to keep track where the remote-heads are per lane. See `RemoteLanes` class for the implementation details.

More places that stores lanes related data:

- the currently checked out lane is saved in the scope.json file. (e.g. `{ lanes: { current: "lane-a", tracking: "remote/lane-a" } }`).
- When switching to a remote lane, the .bitmap is updated as well with the remote-name, so then, when cloning the project, it's possible to fetch the remote lane data.

Summary of when/what lanes data is saved per command:

- `bit lane create`: creates a new lane-object and creates a new lane record in scope.json.
- `bit snap`: adds an entry to the lane-object and to the workspace-lane.
- `bit export`: 1) deletes all records from workspace-lane (as they're in sync with the remote). 2) pushes the lane-object to the remote. On the remote, the lane-object is created or updated/merged.
- `bit switch --remote`: 1) creates/updates lane-object in the scope. 2) creates/updates remote-lane. the remote-lane is updated also for main.
- `bit fetch` or `bit import --objects`: creates/updates remote-lane. the remote-lane is updated also for main. It doesn't update/merge the lane object.

### Merge during import

- When the remote is ahead, it's easy, just update the head to the remote-head.
- When the local and remote have diverged, it's more complex. We need to create a snap-merge that has two parents, one point to the local head and one point to the remote head.
- On `bit import --objects` (or `bit fetch`) we don't merge. The remote head is saved in the .bit/refs/remote dir. Then, `bit status` shows that these components are merge-pending.
- On `bit import <id>` we do the merge.
- in case the merge wasn't done and the user is trying to export, the remote blocks is as it finds out that its head doesn't exist on the incoming component.
- in case the snap-merge failed due to a conflict, it saves the conflict and heads data into `.bit/unmerged.json` file.

### Merge components

- to merge an entire lane, use `bit lane merge`.
- to get updates from a remote lane, run `bit import`, and then `bit checkout head`. alternatively, run `bit merge <component-id>` in one command.
- to merge an individual component from a lane to main, run `bit lane merge <lane> --pattern <component-id>` when on main.

### Useful APIs

- bit-map `getAllIdsAvailableOnLane()` filters the currently checked out lane.

### Remove component from a lane

Locally, to remove a component from a lane, use `bit remove` command. It will remove the component from the local lane-object.
This change won't affect the remote scope, even after exporting the lane. This is becuase on the remote, the merge-lane process doesn't remove anything, only adds/changes components to the lane object.
Remember that by default when importing a lane, only the components on the workspace are part of the lane, so the same lane-object, locally can have less components than the remote and obviously in this case we don't want to remove them from the remote on export.
