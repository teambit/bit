It provides an API to write configuration files in the workspace, and also provides cli commands to write configuration files.

### Register configuration writers

This aspect provides a `registerConfigWriter` function to register configuration writers.
It accpets an array of `ConfigWriterEntry`.
See the exported interface for more details.

### Commands

Main command is `bit ws-config` which has the following sub commands:

- `bit ws-config write` - write configuration files according to the components' envs
- `bit ws-config clean` - remove all configuration files from the workspace
- `bit ws-config list` - list all registered configuration writers.
  this is useful for filtering used configuration writers when using the `--writers` flag in the write/clean commands.
