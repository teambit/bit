`teambit.workspace/variants` enables cascading configurations by selection of component groupings or sets in the workspace and applying configurations to these cascading groups.
Configurations set on a certain set of components can:

1. Affect only the selected set of components
1. Inherit policies set on a more general set of components (including the workspace default configs)
1. Override conflicting configurations inherited from more general component selections
1. Propagate configurations downwards to more specific sub-sets of components

## Variants Examples

### The Wildcard (\*) variant

To select all components in the workspace use a wildcard (`*`). This is useful when wanting to apply a very general rules on all components. For example:

```json
"teambit.workspace/variants": {
    "*": {
        "teambit.harmony/node": {}
    },
}
```

### Select a rule set by directory

To select a set using a directory path, use the relative path to the components' parent directory. In the following example, all components under the `components/utility-functions` directory
(and any sub-directories) will be included in this set:

```json
"teambit.workspace/variants": {
    "components/utility-functions": {
        "teambit.harmony/node": {}
    },
}
```

### Select a rule set via namespace

This option is recommended as it decouples your components' configurations from the workspace's file structure. It handles components using fundamental definitions that pertain to function and purpose, via their namespace.  
In the following example, any component under the `utility-functions` namespace (and it's sub-namespaces) will be included in this rule set:

```json
"teambit.workspace/variants": {
    "{utility-functions/*}": {
        "teambit.harmony/node": {}
    },
}
```

### Several rule sets with the same variant configuration

You can add several rule sets for the same variant configuration:

```json title="Multiple directory paths"
"teambit.workspace/variants": {
    "components/utils, components/react-ui": {
        "teambit.harmony/node": {}
    },
}
```

```json title="Multiple namespaces"
"teambit.workspace/variants": {
    "{utility-functions/*}, {react-ui/*}": {
        "teambit.harmony/node": {}
    },
}
```

```json title="Paths and namespaces"
"teambit.workspace/variants": {
    "{utility-functions/*}, {react-ui/*}, components/utils, components/react-ui": {
        "teambit.harmony/node": {}
    },
}
```

### Exclude directories/components from a rule

Using the `!` you can exclude set of components from a specific rule.
The `!` works both for directories and namespaces, for example:

#### Exclude directory from a rule

For example, apply the `teambit.harmony/node` environment on the `utility-functions` set, but exclude on `utility-functions/react-utils` from that set:

```json title="workspace.json
"teambit.workspace/variants": {
    "components/utility-functions, !components/utility-functions/react-utils": {
        "teambit.harmony/node": {}
    },
}
```

#### Exclude namespace from a rule

For exapmle, apply the `teambit.harmony/node` environment on every component under the `utils` namespace but exclude the `utils/react` namespace and its children from this set:

```json title="workspace.json
"teambit.workspace/variants": {
    "{utils/*}, !{utils/react/*}": {
        "teambit.harmony/node": {}
    },
}
```

## Merging Configurations

The same component may have several rules applied to it. This works very much like CSS rules where rules cascade but the more specific variant "wins" when there are rule 'conflicts'.

The following example shows how Bit does not apply `aspect1-components-key` nor the `aspect1-root-key` for components under the `components/ui` directory, as the `my-aspect1` extension
was re-set by a more specific variant.

```json title="workspace.json
{
  "teambit.workspace/variants": {
    "*": {
      "my-aspect1": {
        "aspect1-root-key": "aspect1-root-val"
      },
      "my-aspect2": {
        "aspect2-root-key": "aspect2-root-val"
      },
      "my-aspect4": {
        "aspect4-root-key": "aspect4-root-val"
      }
    },
    "components": {
      "my-aspect1": {
        "aspect1-components-key": "aspect1-components-val"
      },
      "my-aspect2": {
        "aspect2-components-key": "aspect2-components-val"
      }
    },
    "components/ui": {
      "my-aspect1": {
        "aspect1-components-ui-key": "aspect1-components-ui-val"
      },
      "my-aspect3": {
        "aspect3-components-ui-key": "aspect3-components-ui-val"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```json title="components/ui/button's calculated configuration"
{
  "my-aspect1": {
    "aspect1-components-ui-key": "aspect1-components-ui-val"
  },
  "my-aspect2": {
    "aspect2-components-key": "aspect2-components-val"
  },
  "my-aspect3": {
    "aspect3-components-ui-key": "aspect3-components-ui-val"
  },
  "my-aspect4": {
    "aspect4-root-key": "aspect4-root-val"
  }
}
```

## Variants configurations

### propagate

Configurations set on one group of components are inherited by its sub-groups (in a CSS-like manner). For example, `components/react/ui` will inherit configurations from `components/react`.
To prevent this from happening, set the `propogate` value of a group of components to `false`.
Once bit see `"propagate": false` it takes the configuration for this group, and stop propagate.

```json title="workspace.json
"teambit.workspace/variants": {
  "components/react": {
    "my-aspect2": {
      "aspect2-react-key": "aspect2-react-val"
    }
  },
  "components/react/ui": {
    "propagate": false, // take this config, and stop propagate
    "my-aspect1": {
      "aspect1-react-ui-key": "aspect1-react-ui-val"
    }
  }
}
```

```json title="components/react/ui/button's calculated configuration"
{
  "my-aspect1": {
    "aspect1-react-ui-key": "aspect1-react-ui-val"
  }
}
```

## Removing aspects

> Note: Once a component has been tagged, any aspect configured for that component **can only** be removed from the component via the following `remove` method. (if you havent exported yet then `untag` would reset the effect of the tag)

There are numerous scenarios where you would not want a specific aspect to be defined on a subgroup but you don't want to exclude the sub-group from upstream rules, or use the `propagate: false` flag, since you want to receive the
other configurations from the parent group rule/s.

In that case, removing a specific aspect can be achieved using `"-"` as the value for an aspect's configuration. This will remove this aspect from the current rule set.

For instance, the following will remove `my-aspect2` from components in the `components/react/ui` set, while still inheriting other configs such as the `my-aspect3` aspect.

```json title="workspace.json
"teambit.workspace/variants": {
  "components/react": {
    "my-aspect2": {
      "aspect2-react-key": "aspect2-react-val"
    },
    "my-aspect3": {
      "aspect3-react-key": "aspect3-react-val"
    }
  },
  "components/react/ui": {
    "my-aspect1": {
      "aspect1-react-ui-key": "aspect1-react-ui-val"
    },
    "my-aspect2": "-" // Remove my-aspect2 from this set's configuration
  }
}
```

```json title="components/react/ui/button's calculated configuration"
{
  "my-aspect1": {
    "aspect1-react-ui-key": "aspect1-react-ui-val"
  },
  "my-aspect3": {
    "aspect3-react-key": "aspect3-react-val"
  }
}
```
