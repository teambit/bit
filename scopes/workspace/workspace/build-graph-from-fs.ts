  /**
   * create a graph with all dependencies and flattened dependencies of the given components.
   * the nodes are components and the edges has a label of the dependency type.
   *
   * the way how it is done is iterations by depths. each depth we gather all the dependencies of
   * that depths, make sure all objects exist and then check their dependencies for the next depth.
   * once there is no dependency left, we're on the last depth level and the graph is ready.
   *
   * for example, imagine the following graph:
   * A1 -> A2 -> A3
   * B1 -> B2 -> B3
   * C1 -> C2 -> C3
   *
   * where the buildGraph is given [A1, B1, C1].
   * first, it saves all these components as nodes in the graph. then, it finds the dependencies of
   * the next level, in this case they're [A2, B2, C2]. it runs `importMany` in case some objects
   * are missing. then, it loads them all (some from FS, some from the model) and sets the edges
   * between the component and the dependencies.
   * once done, it finds all their dependencies, which are [A3, B3, C3] and repeat the process
   * above. since there are no more dependencies, the graph is completed.
   * in this case, the total depth levels are 3.
   *
   * even with a huge project, there are not many depth levels. by iterating through depth levels
   * we keep performance sane as the importMany doesn't run multiple time and therefore the round
   * trips to the remotes are minimal.
   *
   * normally, one importMany of the seeders is enough as importMany knows to fetch all flattened.
   * however, since this buildGraph is performed on the workspace, a dependency may be new or
   * modified and as such, we don't know its flattened yet.
