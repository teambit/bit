/**
 * the goal of this class is to determine the graph dependencies of a given set of components with minimal effort.
 * it takes advantage of the fact that we save the dependency graph in the `Version` object and tries to reuse it.
 *
 * to optimize it as much as possible, we do it in 4 steps. each step we check whether the graph has missing ids,
 * and if so, continue to the next step.
 *
 * * * First step * * *
 * we have two groups in this graph.
 * 1. components that are now versioned (this.consumerComponents). they have the new version (which is not in the scope yet).
 * 2. component that are not part of the current snap/tag.
 * it's not possible that this group has new components that never been into the scope, otherwise the tag/snap is failing.
 * so we know we can always find the version-object of these components in the scope or import them.
 *
 * given the above. we can simply get the first level of dependencies of the first group.
 * start the graph by adding them all as nodes and edges.
 *
 * this dependencies array may contain components from the first group. we can filter them out. (we don't care about
 * them, they're part of the graph already)
 * we're left with the dependencies that are part of the second group. there are the `missingFromGraph`.
 *
 * * * Second step * * *
 * instead of import these components, we can more efficiently get their previous version from the scope.
 * it must be already in the scope because these are the components we load in the first place.
 * chances are that 99% of the dependencies of the current components objects are identical to the previous version.
 * by adding the flattenedEdges of the previous versions we can probably finish the graph without importing a single
 * component. It's ok that this graph of previous versions has ids that are not relevant to this graph. for example, if
 * we now tag bar@0.0.2, this graph will have bar@0.0.1 although it's not relevant. it's ok, because finally we don't
 * use this graph as a whole. we only pick a component and get its sub-graph, so all irrelevant ids are ignored.
 *
 * * * Third step * * *
 * in case the graph above wasn't enough. we can import the missing components and get their flattenedEdges.
 * all components that were snapped/tagged since around 0.0.8000 have the flattenedEdges saved in the version.
 * older components don't have them and that's why the last step is needed.
 *
 * * * Fourth step * * *
 * this is the worst scenario. we have some old dependencies without flattenedEdges, we have to import them with
 * all their flattened dependencies.
 * once we have all these objects we can iterate them and add them to the graph.
