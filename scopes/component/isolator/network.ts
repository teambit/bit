/**
 * collection of isolated components (capsules).
 * normally, "seeders" are the components that this network was created for.
 * "graphCapsules" is the graph created from the seeders and it includes also the dependencies.
 *
 * however, during "bit build"/"bit tag"/"bit snap", things are more complex because there is one more variable in the
 * picture, which is the "env". the Network is created per env.
 * in practice, for "build-task", a task is called per env, and the network passed to the task is relevant to that env.
 * the "originalSeeders" are the ones the network was created for, but only for this env.
 * the "seeders" are similar to the "graphCapsules" above, which contains also the dependencies, but only for this env.
 * the "graphCapsules" is the entire graph, including capsules from other envs.
 *
 * for example:
 * comp1 depends on comp2. comp1 env is "react". comp2 env is "aspect".
 *
 * when the user is running "bit build comp1", two `Network` instances will be created with the following:
 * Network for "react" env:  originalSeeders: ['comp1'], seeders: ['comp1'], graphCapsules: ['comp1', 'comp2'].
 * Network for "aspect" env: originalSeeders: [], seeders: ['comp2'], graphCapsules: ['comp2'].
 *
 * on the other hand, when the user is running "bit capsule create comp1", only one `Network` instance is created:
 * Network: originalSeeders: ['comp1'], seeders: ['comp1'], graphCapsules: ['comp1', 'comp2'].
 *
 * (as a side note, another implementation was attempt to have the "seeders" as the original-seeders for build,
 * however, it's failed. see https://github.com/teambit/bit/pull/5407 for more details).
