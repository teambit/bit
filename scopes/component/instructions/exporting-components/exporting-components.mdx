# Versioning and Exporting Components

To export your components to the cloud so that they can be installed elsewhere you first have to tag and then export your components. When we version or 'tag' a component, we commit changes and prepare it to be exported to a remote scope. This process most often includes compiling and testing, as well.

## Tag a component

```bash
bit tag <component-id> --patch --message "this is the tag message"
```

### Tag all components that have been modified

Tag all components and bump the patch number of each component version

```bash
bit tag --all
```

## Export your Components

Once you have tagged your component you can then run the bit export command.

```bash
bit export
```
