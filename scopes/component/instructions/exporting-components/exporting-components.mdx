> To export your components to the cloud so that they can be installed elsewhere you first have to tag and then export your components.

When we version or 'tag' a component, we commit changes and prepare it to be exported to a remote scope. This process most often includes compiling and testing, as well.

### How to Tag a component

```bash
bit tag <component-id> --patch --message "this is the tag message"
```

#### How to Tag all components that have been modified

Tag all components and bump the patch number of each component version

```bash
bit tag --all
```

### How to Export your Components

Once you have tagged your component you can then run the bit export command.

```bash
bit export
```
