description: Separator component to separate content in either semantic or presentational way

## Separator for semantic or presentational usage

Separator component uses a `<hr>` to give a semantic separator. When the isPresentational flag is passed it creates a `<div>`with a border to give a horizontal line for presentational usage.

"Historically, a `<hr>` has been presented as a horizontal rule or line. While it may still be displayed as a horizontal rule in visual browsers, this element is now defined in semantic terms, rather than presentational terms, so if you wish to draw a horizontal line, you should do so using appropriate CSS."
