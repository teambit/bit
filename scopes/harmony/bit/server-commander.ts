/**
 * This file is responsible for interacting with bit through a long-running background process "bit-server" rather than directly.
 * Why not directly?
 * 1. startup cost. currently it takes around 1 second to bootstrap bit.
 * 2. an experimental package-manager saves node_modules in-memory. if a client starts a new process, it won't have the node_modules in-memory.
 *
 * In this file, there are three ways to achieve this. It's outlined in the order it was evolved.
 * The big challenge here is to show the output correctly to the client even though the server is running in a different process.
 *
 * 1. process.env.BIT_CLI_SERVER === 'true'
 * This method uses SSE - Server Send Events. The server sends events to the client with the output to print. The client listens to
 * these events and prints them. It's cumbersome. For this, the logger was changed and every time the logger needs to print to the console,
 * it was using this SSE to send events. Same with the loader.
 * Cons: Other output, such as pnpm, needs an extra effort to print - for pnpm, the "process" object was passed to pnpm
 * and its stdout was modified to use the SSE.
 * However, other tools that print directly to the console, such as Jest, won't work.
 *
 * 2. process.env.BIT_CLI_SERVER_TTY === 'true'
 * Because the terminal - tty is a fd (file descriptor) on mac/linux, it can be passed to the server. The server can write to this
 * fd and it will be printed to the client terminal. On the server, the process.stdout.write was monkey-patched to
 * write to the tty. (see cli-raw.route.ts file).
 * It solves the problem of Jest and other tools that print directly to the console.
 * Cons:
 * A. It doesn't work on Windows. Windows doesn't treat tty as a file descriptor.
 * B. We need two ways communication. Commands such as "bit update", display a prompt with option to select using the arrow keys.
 *    This is not possible with the tty approach. Also, if the client hits Ctrl+C, the server won't know about it and it
 *    won't kill the process.
 *
 * 3. process.env.BIT_CLI_SERVER_PTY === 'true'
 * This is the most advanced approach. It spawns a pty (pseudo terminal) process to communicate between the client and the server.
 * The client connects to the server using a socket. The server writes to the socket and the client reads from it.
 * The client also writes to the socket and the server reads from it. See server-forever.ts to understand better.
 * In order to pass terminal sequences, such as arrow keys or Ctrl+C, the stdin of the client is set to raw mode.
 * In theory, this approach could work by spawning a normal process, not pty, however, then, the stdin/stdout are non-tty,
 * and as a result, loaders such as Ora and chalk won't work.
 * With this new approach, we also support terminating and reloading the server. A new command is added
 * "bit server-forever", which spawns the pty-process. If the client hits Ctrl+C, this server-forever process will kill
 * the pty-process and re-load it.
 * Keep in mind, that to send the command and get the results, we still using http. The usage of the pty is only for
 * the input/output during the command.
 * I was trying to avoid the http, and use only the pty, by implementing readline to get the command from the socket,
 * but then I wasn't able to return the prompt to the user easily. So, I decided to keep the http for the request/response part.
