/**
 * You might have several processes running in the background (for example, bit watch, bit start, or bit server).
 * When the user runs `bit install`, these processes need to be notified that the installation has completed. One reason
 * is that "bit start" in the workspace could remove component-issues related to missing dependencies.
 *
 * To achieve this, an event file is written to the filesystem (e.g., .bit/events/<event-name>), and each background
 * process has a file watcher monitoring these event files. When an event file is created or updated, they can act upon it.
 *
 * For instance, when the user runs bit install, the “install” aspect calls publishIpcEvent, which writes
 * `.bit/events/onPostInstall`. The "bit start" process (along with others) detects the file change and invokes
 * `ipcEvents.triggerGotEvent()`. Any aspect subscribed to the gotEventSlot then runs its logic. In this example, the
 * installer aspect is subscribed, so when it recognizes the onPostInstall event, it triggers its own OnPostInstall slot.
 *
 * @see ./example-diagram.md for a visual representation of the above.
