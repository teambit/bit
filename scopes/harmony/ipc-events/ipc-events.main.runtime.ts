/**
 * imagine you have multiple processes running in the background, such as `bit watch`, `bit start`, `bit server`.
 * the user is running `bit install` from the cli, how do you let these processes know that the installation is complete?
 * `bit start` for instance could use ths info to clear the "component issues" of the components that were missing packages.
 *
 * this class provides a mechanism to achieve this by writing the event into the filesystem (`.bit/events/event-name`),
 * while each one of the processes has a watcher in the background watch this file. once they got the data from the watcher,
 * they can act upon it.
 *
 * in the previous example, when the user is running `bit install`, the install aspect runs `this.publishIpcEvent` to
 * write `.bit/events/onPostInstall` to the filesystem. then, the watcher of `bit start` process got a notification
 * that this file has changed/added and it runs `triggerGotEvent` to run all aspects registered to its gotEventSlot.
 * the installer in turn is registered to this slot and once its function is triggered, it check whether the eventName
 * is onPostInstall and then triggers its own OnPostInstall slot.
