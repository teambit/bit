pnpm is a Bit aspect that enables the use of the pnpm package manager in a Bit workspace (the pnpm aspect utilizes pnpm's programmatic API).

The pnpm aspect is used **indirectly** by the 'Dependency Resolver'.

## Quickstart

To start using the pnpm aspect as a package manager for your workspace, set the Dependency Resolver `packageManager` property to 'pnpm'.

```json
{
  "teambit.dependencies/dependency-resolver": {
    "packageManager": "teambit.dependencies/pnpm"
  }
}
```

> Package manager are only configurable at th workspace configuration root-level.
> That means, different components in the same workspace cannot use different package manager.

---

> Packages on NPM will be installed from Bit.dev's registry instead of NPM's. This will be done using the user's Bit credentials.

> The pnpm aspect uses Bit's deduping algorithm (not pnpm's).
> It searches for a common version that satisfies _most_ components using the same dependency (taking into consideration permitted version ranges configured for each component) and installs it at the workspace root directory,
> where it can be shared by multiple dependent components.
> Versions that are used by a minority of components will be installed nested in each component directory.

> pnpm cannot be used with the 'React Native environment'.
