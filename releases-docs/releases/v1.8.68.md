### Improvements

- Sort component IDs in `bit export` output, and introduce `--verbose` option to show which versions exported (#9219)
- Add additional examples to `bit env set --help` (#9212)
- Automated API reference now shows complete signature of every API node including docs (#9206)
- Improve CSS/SASS/SCSS dependency detection to support `import ... as ...` and more (#9205)
- `bit dependents` support `--json` option to get easily parse output by another process (#9204)
- `bit build | snap | tag` supports `--skip-tasks` to skip any task from the build pipeline (#9196)
- `bit test` exit with non-zero code when tester fails due to coverage (#9218)
- Following commands and flags are no longer marked as experimental: (#9200)
  - `bit fork --ast` `bit scope fork --ast` `bit rename --ast` `bit scope rename --ast` - use AST to transform component instead of regular expressions
  - `bit recover` - recover component(s) soft-deleted from the workspace, or a remote scope
  - `bit stash` - stash modified components
  - `bit mini-status` - light and fast variation of `bit status`
  - `bit dependencies --tree` - render dependencies as a tree, similar to `npm ls`.
  - `bit lane rename` - change the lane-name locally
  - `bit watch --check-types` - show errors/warnings for types during `bit watch`
