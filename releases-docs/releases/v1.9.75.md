### Improvements

- Allow setting up per-workspace with `--local` option `bit config set user.token xxx --local`, or `--local-track` to have config in `workspace.jsonc` (#9557, #9555)
- Support VScode extension to produce a visual workspace graph for components (#9547, #9545)
- Allow for better control over component's `package.json` when running `bit compile` (#9530)
- Enable auto-formatting components before snap/tag with `workspace.jsonc` config (#9497)
  ```
  "teambit.defender/formatter": {
    "formatOnPreSnap": true
  }
  ```
- Simplify getting `diff` from a version it's parent with `--parent`. Instead of `bit diff foo 0.0.1 0.0.2` you can `bit diff foo 0.0.2 --parent` (#9498)
- Improve various CLI/UI outputs and errors for better DX (#9507, #9502, #9506)
- Support syntax highlighting for `.cjs` and `/mjs` (#9492)
