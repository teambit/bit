### New Features

- New `bit deps diagnose` command to analyze workspace dependency bloat by scanning `node_modules/.pnpm`, reporting top version-spread packages, and identifying peer dependencies causing combinatorial explosion. Use `--package <name>` to drill down into a specific package (#10189)
- **Community Workspace Starters** registered directly in core, enabling `bit new react`, `bit new platform`, and `bit new harmony` to work without requiring `--aspect` or `--env` flags (#10156)
- **Lane History** commands are now stable — removed EXPERIMENTAL marks from all lane history subcommands. `bit lane history-diff` now works with 0, 1, or 2 arguments for easier usage (#10192)

### Improvements

- Add `--skip-push` flag to `bit ci merge` command for organizations where CI pipelines need to handle the push step separately (#10171)
- **Workspace Overview Aggregation** is now sticky and URL-driven (#10161)
- Allow creating a new lane when the current lane has staged or diverged components (#10155)
- Show helpful message when `bit check-types` has no components to check, similar to other commands (#10151)
- Show actual env name in `bit templates` output instead of internal aspect IDs (#10152)
- Clarify `--write-deps` option in `bit import` help output (#10158)
- Improve CLI skill command discoverability (#10190)

### Performance

- Batch `getDiagnostic` calls in `bit check-types` to avoid overwhelming tsserver on large workspaces, resulting in ~35% performance improvement (#10180)
- Convert recursive version-history traversal to iterative to prevent stack overflow on repositories with deep version histories (2000+ versions) (#10144)

### Bug Fixes

- Fix an issue where `bit init --external-package-manager` added `"type": "module"` to an existing `package.json` (#10148)
- Fix an issue where `bit init` with `externalPackageManager: true` didn't include `bit ws-config write` in the postinstall script (#10147)
- Fix an issue where env dependencies were incorrectly installed as dependencies of user components (#10150)
- Fix an issue where `bit install` failed with "isn't supported by any available resolver" when `env.jsonc` contained `+` version placeholders (#10154)
- Fix an issue where the isolator overwrote the merged `package.json` when `populateArtifactsFrom` was set during tag after snap (#10166)
- Fix an issue where `react-dom` peer dependency version could get out of sync with `react` from the env's default peers (#10195)
- Fix an issue where lane merge didn't add a history entry when merging without snap (#10149)
- Fix an issue where `bit doctor --archive --exclude-local-scope` didn't exclude `.bit/objects` when run from a nested directory (#10184)
- Fix an issue where MDX dependency detection crashed on files with legacy syntax instead of falling back to regex-based import extraction (#10174)
- Fix an issue where the TypeScript parser crashed on malformed AST nodes, taking down the UI server (#10165)
- Fix an issue where the TypeScript compiler returned duplicate task results for components using custom envs (#10162)
- Fix an issue where WebSocket proxy connections didn't forward authentication headers (#10141)
- Fix an issue where orphaned bit server processes ran indefinitely when the parent process crashed (#10142)
- Fix an issue where EventSource clients (e.g., VS Code extension) stayed in CONNECTING state due to missing initial SSE event (#10159)
- Fix an issue where `bit ci pr` failed with "lane exists with different hash" when multiple CI jobs ran concurrently on the same branch (#10183)
- Fix UI issues in workspace overview padding and aggregation control styles (#10160, #10169)
- Fix Live Controls dropdown menus being clipped by overflow containers (#10164)
- Fix an issue where schema for historical component versions wasn't loaded correctly on workspace (#10170)

### Internal

- Update pnpm (#10143)
- Upgrade `babel-loader` to 9.2.1 (#10196)
- Add `@parcel/watcher` to default scripts allow list and add `micromatch` as direct dependency (#10163, #10182)
