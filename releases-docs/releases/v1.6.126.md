### New Features

- Set `BIT_DISABLE_CONSOLE=true BIT_DISABLE_SPINNER=true` to get more focused CI logs (#8765)
- `bit login --refresh-token` to generate a new token, instead of `bit logout && bit login`, also added prompt when running `bit login` when token is already set (#8760, #8758)

### Changes

- Improve CLI and terminal outputs (#8764, #8740, #8739, #8718, #8720, #8751)
- Enforce cases where component should import it's own files, not it's module (for example, for component `@teambit/design.button` use `import { Button } from "./button"` instead of `import { Button } from "@teambit/design.button"`) (#8757)
- Component dependencies in `workspace.jsonc` entries to update during `bit import` (#8761)

### Performance

- 50% faster compile step during `bit build` when using `@teambit/typescript.typescript-compiler@^2.0.27` (#8755, #8773, #8774)
- `bit compile` and `bit link` are about 60% faster, each (#8734)
- Tarball from `bit doctor --archive` is much smaller (#8767)
- Improve "component loading" slightly (#8752)
- Cache modules manifest (#8736)

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where Webpack on windows failed during preview because not finding all assets for bundle size calculation (#8785)
- Fixed a bug where existing the compile step during `bit build` (Ctrl+C) didn't work (#8775)
- Ensure network settings passed correctly to pnpm (#8772)
- Fix an issue where `bit login` happens before loading of any aspects or components, so user doesn't hit 404 error (#8750)
- Fix an issue where using package name for commands where component was private failed (#8748)
- Various fixes for ensuring dependency management is more deterministic (#8754, #8768, #8741, #8746, #8737 )
- Fixed an issue where `bit status` warned about circular dependencies even after issue resolved (#8735)

### Internal

- Update compilation for core Bit aspects (#8769, #8776, #8745, #8730, #8697, #8756)
- Update many e2e tests (#8749, #8732)
- Remove some legacy code (#8742, #8747)
- Eject core code to external components (#8762)
- Fix setup scripts on Windows (#8727)
- Improve how Bit finds the instance of "component-issue" (#8777)
- Report `config.user_name` during package installation (#8759)
- Refactor some code paths (#8600, #8731)
