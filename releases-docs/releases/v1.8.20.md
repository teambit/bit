### New Features

- Introduce **Local Only Component** workspace feature (#9059, #9057)
  - Mark any number of components as **Local Only** with the new `bit local-only set <component>` command
  - **Local Only** components allow you to avoid tagging/releasing specific components, even if they are modified, or their dependencies are modified.
  - Scenario 1 - I have an app in the workspace, which I want to be able to `bit run`, but I don't want to trigger it's build, as I am focused only on the components, while the app itself will be built and released from a different workflow.
  - Scenario 2 - I want to have a small component in my workspace as a basic "consumer" for my other components, and I don't want it published, as it is a testing environment for me and not a reuseable asset.

### Improvements

- Jest upgraded from 26 to 29 for all core environments (#9015, #9052)
  - Only relevant for teams who either directly use, or customize the following: `teambit.react/react`, `teambit.harmony/node`, `teambit.react/react-native`.
- Support `--update-snapshot` option for `bit test`
  - Requires updating your env, or `@teambit/defender.jest-tester` and `@teambit/vite.vitest-tester` plugins if you have a custom env (#9025)
- Quick search (`cmd+k`) now supports opening links in new tabs and few more UX updates (#9054)
- Workspace starter (`bit new`) now supports creating custom envs and new components that use the new custom envs (#9036)
- Add tooltip with full filename in file tree (#9066)
- Add environments when initializing a workspace with `bit init --generator [envs]` option (#9064)
- Add deprecation warning for teams using the Eslint/Prettier aspects directly and not through the designated plugins (#9050)
- Introduce `--force-ours` and `--force-theirs` options for `bit switch` to override files in the workspace instead of trying to merge (#9048)
- `bit list` command marks deleted components, and also sorted alphabetically (#9042, #9041)

### Performance

- Support SSR for the Bit UI during `bit start` (#8915)
- Avoid adding apps to `workspace.jsonc` during `bit create`, as this is no longer needed (and impacts command load time) (#9061, #9037)

### Bug Fixes

- Fix an issue where `bit create` for a component with existing name but different scope failed (#9082)
- Fix an issue where `bit doctor` command exited upon any check failure (#9072)
- Fix an issue where if a package is duplicate in runtime and dev and `bit deps remove --dev` was used, dependency wasn't removed (#9070)
- Fix an issue where short-hash version was written to `.bitmap` instead of long-hash (#9067)
- Fix an issue where tagging a pre-release allows for an illegal version name (#9063)
- Fix several issues in generating automated API References (#9062, #9060)
- Fix an issue where dependency version was not saved correctly (#9039)
- Fix an issue where `bit show` listed incorrect version when `bit deps set` was used (#9035)
- Fix and issue where dependency installation on `bit switch --main` fails when app is configured in `workspace.jsonc` but not in `.bitmap` (#9038)

### Internal

- Refactor build pipeline for core environments (#9055)
- Prepare Bit for Cloud Workspaces (#9081, #9080, #9079, #9078, #9077, #9076, #9069, #9053, #9046, #9047, #9028)
- Prepare for VSCode plugin upgrades (#9065)
- Ability to have a Bit Aspect with a custom env (#9045)
