### New Features

- Navigate from components to their dependencies from the code viewer (#8556)
- Mark a component to be a `peerDependency` when installed to a workspace with `bit set-peer <comp> [range]` (#8591, #8561)
- Introduce "--skip-tasks" flag to filter out specific tasks from a build pipeline (#8611)

### Changes

- Update base component templates (#8574, #8573, #8588, #8614)
- Generate `package.json` with `type:module` on `bit init` (#8572)
- Improve various CLI outputs and errors (#8605, #8603, #8602, #8592, #8585, #8532, #8578, #8593, #8595)

### Performance

- Fix an issue where comparing for modifications was against the `head` of the lane, not what is `current` in workspace (#8554)
- Fix an issue where components marked as `peerDependencies` are missing many "component dependencies" features, like being presented on the dependency graph, and not triggering auto-tag (#6375)
- During `update-dependents` ensure dependency versions are set according to the lane (#8566)
- Fix an issue where `peerDependencies` changes weren't listed on `bit diff` (#8586)

- Convert `mainFile` to linux format before saving into component objects (#8608)

### Internal
