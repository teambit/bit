## [0.5.5] - 2017-05-09

### Change

- bare scope test creates a new environment and runs the tests there.
- test command -i runs the tests on the file system (inline components).
- build command now saves dist/\<implFileName> && dist/\<specsFileName> for the specs file.
- change the component resolver to fetch from dist/\<implFileName> instead of dist/dist.js.

- package dependencies of environment modules would be installed at component level from now.
- npm loader would not be present, --verbose will show npm output after the installation is done.

### Fixed

- bug with environment installation (npm install at project level).

### Added

- add module 'component-resolver' to resolve a component path using its ID.
- support generating an isolated bit-component environment on-the-fly so it will be easier to run build and test from everywhere
- the compiler can implement a build method instead of compile, get an entry file and run webpack for example (wip). implemented for inline_components, and still need to implement environment module in order to fully work.
- add --skip-update option to the main bit help page.
- run some hooks (for now: onCommit, onCreate, onExport and onImport) using a language-driver
- lang attribute on the bit.json, enable language that will save on the model of the component.
