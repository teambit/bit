[Bit](https://bit.dev) is the build system to connect components and apps from development to CI in the AI era. Bit organizes source code into composable components, empowering to build reliable, scalable and consistent applications. It enables AI agents to intelligenly create and reuse components via MCP preventing duplication and accelerating development.

âš¡ **Features**

- **Reusable components.** Create reusable UI components and modules to reuse across your software.
- **Standard building blocks.** Define the blueprints templates for creating components for devs and AI as one.
- **Shell applications.** Compose reusable components and features into application shells.
- **Atmoic and safe deployments.** Ensure simple, safe and optimized deployments of apps and services for testing and production.

Bit supports all tooling in the JS ecosystem and comes out of the box with official dev environments for [NodeJS](https://bit.dev/docs/backend-intro), [React](https://bit.dev/docs/react-intro), [Angular](https://bit.dev/docs/angular-introduction), [Vue](https://bit.dev/docs/vue-intro), [React Native](https://bit.dev/docs/react-native-intro), [NextJS](https://bit.dev/docs/quick-start/hello-world-nextjs) and [far more](https://bit.dev/docs). All are native to TypeScript and ESM and equipped with the best dev tooling.

Bit is a fit to every codebase structure. You can use Bit components in a monorepo, polyrepo, or even without repositories at all. 

## Getting started

### Install Bit

Use the Bit installer to install Bit to be available on your PATH.

```bash
npx @teambit/bvm install
```

Initialize Bit on a new folder or in an existing project by running the following command:

```bash
bit init --default-scope my-org.my-project
```

Make sure to [create your scope on the Bit platform](https://bit.cloud/signup) and use the right org and project name. After running the command, Bit is initialized on the chosen directory, and ready to be used via Bit commands, [AI agent, your editor](https://bit.dev/docs/getting-started/installing-bit/editor-setup) or the Bit UI!

### Create shell application

Create the application shell to run, compose and deploy your application:

```bash
bit create react-app corporate-website
```

Run the platform:

```
bit run corporate-website
```

Head to http://localhost:3000 to view your application shell. You can start composing the application layout and specific pages to build your application. Learn more on [building shell applications](https://bit.dev/docs/getting-started/composing/create-apps).

### Compose components

Create the components to compose into the feature. Run the following command to create a new React UI component for the application login route:

```
bit create react pages/login
```

Find simple guides for creating NodeJS modules, UI components and apps, backend services and more on the [Create Component docs](https://bit.dev/docs/getting-started/composing/creating-components/). 

Compose the component into the application shell:

```ts
import { Login } from '@my-org/users.pages.login';
import { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

export function CorporateWebsite() {
  return (
    <AcmeTheme>
      <NavigationProvider>
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={<div>Hello world</div>} />
          <Route path="/login" element={<Login />} />
        </Routes>
      </NavigationProvider>
    </AcmeTheme>
  );
}

```
Head to http://localhost:3000/login to view your new login page.
You can use bit templates to list official templates or find guides for creating React hooks, backend services, NodeJS modules, UI components and more on our [create components docs](https://bit.dev/docs/getting-started/composing/creating-components). Optionally, use bit start to run the Bit UI to preview components in isolation.

### Release and deploy

You can either use hosted scopes on [Bit Cloud](https://bit.cloud) or by [hosting scopes on your own](https://bit.dev/reference/scope/running-a-scope-server). Use the following command to create your Bit Cloud account and your first scope.

```bash
bit login
```

Use semantic versioning to version your components:

```bash
bit tag --message "my first release" --major
```

By default, Bit uses [Ripple CI](https://bit.cloud/products/ripple-ci) to build components. You can use the `--build` flag to build the components on the local machine. To tag and export from your CI of choice to automate the release process or use [our official CI scripts](https://bit.dev/docs/getting-started/collaborate/exporting-components#ci-scripts).

After versioning, you can proceed to release your components:

```bash
bit export
```

### Modernize existing projects

Head over to your [bit.cloud account](https://bit.cloud) to see your components build progress. Once the build process is completed, the components will be available for use using standard package managers:

```bash
npm install @my-org/users.pages.login
```

## Next steps

- [Create more components](https://bit.dev/docs/getting-started/composing/creating-components/)
- [Setup your editor](https://bit.dev/docs/getting-started/installing-bit/editor-setup)
- [Configure CI of choice](https://bit.dev/docs/getting-started/collaborate/exporting-components/#ci-scripts)
- [Start from an existing project](https://bit.dev/docs/getting-started/installing-bit/start-from-existing-project)

## Contributors

Bit is entirely built with Bit and you can find all its components on [Bit Cloud](https://bit.cloud/teambit/~scopes).
