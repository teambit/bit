Bit is a toolchain for **composable software**. It makes the development of composable software simple and fast.

Bit is similar in sense, but stands as the opposite for the "Monorepo" approach, which aims to center all code under a central repository. Instead Bit is bringing simplicity for distribution of source code into to independent components, composing each other.

People often use Bit to run a Monorepo, sometimes a Polyrepo or without using repositories at all.

The core innovation of Bit is the ["Bit Component"](https://bit.dev/#component), a composable container for source code, whereas dependencies are first-class citizens. Components can be used as packages, ESM modules, runtime scripts, and any other artifact a build task can generate.

- **Descriptive module names**. Use components through descriptive package names. No aliases required.
- **Dependency versioning.**. Automatically detect and version dependency changes.
- **Reusable development environments.** Your own "create-react-app", create a development environment for your components, automating all configuration files for your components ().
- **Build pipelines**. Independent build pipelines for components, designed for performance and speed.
- **Preview and auto-generated docs**. Every component is an asset with auto-generated docs and component previews.
- **Lanes**. Propose and change components to introduce new features, in collaboration with others.
- **Component generators**. Create new components using pre-built or custom templates for any type of component.


## Getting started

### Install Bit
Use the Bit installer to install Bit to be available on your PATH.

```bash
npx @teambit/bvm install
```

### Create a new workspace

Run the following to create a workspace with a few components included, using the hello-world starter:
```bash
bit new hello-world my-hello-world --env teambit.community/starters/hello-world 
```

For the quick start, we use two React components and one Node module, though you can create components in pretty much every language.
This will create a new workspace with two react components and a single node component. Bit can be used in diff

### Create a component
```bash
bit create node is-string 
```

### Record component and dependency changes

Run the following to record component changes to your components, and assign a semantic version to them. Bit will version the dependents graph of the changed components.

```bash
bit snap --message 'initial release'
```

Snapped components are ready to be built upon 'export' (see next step). The build artifacts will also be stored in the component's new version ('snap').

By default, components are built using bit.cloud's CI platform, Ripple CI. However, you can run the components' build locally by adding the --build flag, or use your own CI platform. [To learn more see Set up CI](https://bit.dev/).

### Export components to a remote scope.

```bash
bit export
```

Your components are now built, and available to be used as packages.

Bit is entirely built with Bit and you can find all its components on [Bit Cloud Here](https://bit.cloud/teambit/~scopes).
