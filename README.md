# Bit is the platform for collaborating on components

[Documentation](https://docs.bit.dev) ‚Ä¢ [Tutorials](https://docs.bit.dev/docs/tutorials/bit-react-tutorial) ‚Ä¢ [Quick start guide ](https://docs.bit.dev/docs/quick-start) ‚Ä¢ [Workflows](https://docs.bit.dev/docs/workflows/workflows) ‚Ä¢ [bit.dev components cloud](https://bit.dev) ‚Ä¢ [Video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5lgoz6-nfs) 

## What is Bit? ü§î

Bit is an [open-source](https://github.com/teambit/bit) cli tool for collaborating on isolated components across projects and repositories.  
Use Bit to distribute discrete components from a design library or a project into a standalone reusable package and utilize it across applications.  
You can set up your own server for components collaboration, or use the [bit.dev cloud](#bitdev-cloud-%EF%B8%8F) hosting for private and public components sharing.

## Why Bit? üéñÔ∏è

Bit facilitates the process of collaborating on UI components. Team members can share, maintain, and synchronize isolated components from different projects.  

Bit allows teams to:

- Increase code reusability
- Increase design and development efficiency
- Retain UI and UX consistency
- Increase project's stability

## Key Features üîë

- Extract a component for sharing directly from an existing library or project.
- Validate the component's independence by building and testing each component separately from the rest of the project.
- Change the source code of shared components from any application that utilizes it.
- Get published changes in components on top of local modifications.
- Contribute back changes made to components directly from the consuming applications.
- Automatically wrap each component as an npm package.
- Distribute discrete components instead of a single massive package.
- Automate component versioning according to changes in its dependencies.
- Use with leading frameworks and tools: React, Vue, Angular, Mocha, Jest.  
- Works alongside Git, NPM, and Yarn.

Bit is working with Javascript and Javascript frameworks:
