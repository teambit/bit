# Bit

Bit is a tool for composing modern applications of independent components.  

It extends the benefits of micro-services to everything you build, front and back. With Bit teams can autonomously develop, build, and release components, while continuously collaborating and integrating to compose larger applications together.  

Bit's extendible toolset (and visual development UI) creates a simple yet powerful experience for every developer, while larger teams can smoothly scale to build many developers and projects in the [component cloud](https://bit.dev/).

Modularity benefits almost every part of the development process, from [speeding up releases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDjTcBKXKDE) to making debugging or refactoring much simpler. You can start enjoying Bit through one of many popular [use-cases](https://blog.bitsrc.io/4-bit-use-cases-build-like-the-best-teams-1c36560c7c6e) such as **Micro Frontends**, **Design Systems**, **Development Speed**, and **Collaboration on components**.

## Large scale example of building with Bit

Bit is 100% built with Bit! Every feature in Bit, from the [Bit Version Manager](https://bit.dev/teambit/bvm) to the workspace UI and even [supporting MDX](https://bit.dev/teambit/mdx), are just scopes of components developed with Bit.

Explore [dozens of OSS scopes and hundreds of OSS components](https://bit.dev/teambit) on Bit's cloud platform.
