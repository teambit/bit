# Bit

Bit is a tool for composing modern applications of independent components. ¬†

It extends the benefits of micro-services to everything you build, front and back. With Bit teams can autonomously develop, build, and release components, while continuously collaborating and integrating to compose larger applications together. ¬†

Bit's extendible toolset (and visual development UI) creates a simple yet powerful experience for every developer, while larger teams can smoothly scale to build many developers and projects in the [component cloud](https://bit.dev/).

Modularity benefits almost every part of the development process, from [speeding up releases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDjTcBKXKDE) to making debugging or refactoring much simpler. You can start enjoying Bit through one of many popular [use-cases](https://blog.bitsrc.io/4-bit-use-cases-build-like-the-best-teams-1c36560c7c6e) such as **Micro Frontends**, **Design Systems**, **Development Speed**, and **Collaboration on components**.

## Large scale example of building with Bit

Bit is 100% built with Bit! Every feature in Bit, from the [Bit Version Manager](https://bit.dev/teambit/bvm) to the workspace UI and even [supporting MDX](https://bit.dev/teambit/mdx), are just scopes of components developed with Bit.

Explore [dozens of OSS scopes and hundreds of OSS components](https://bit.dev/teambit) on Bit's cloud platform.
