/**
 * previously, when a Version hash was changed, you'd get an error upon importing the component
 *
 * âžœ  bit import hash-mismatch-case/foo
found hash mismatch of hash-mismatch-case/foo, version 0.0.1.
  originalHash: 6bd019fe5dbf11a5adf2f68d0099457ad077fa8c.
  currentHash: d24622f13dbbbc8b1f59535a8bea342924b8867a
  this usually happens when a component is old and the migration script was not running or interrupted
 *
 * it's impossible to change the calculated hash during the e2e-tests. so we can't generate this
 * case on the fly. instead, we prepared such a scope from advance and copied it into the fixtures
 * directory. (at fixtures/scopes/hash-mismatch-case). this dir contains a complete bare scope that
 * has one component "foo" and its version (0.0.1) has a hash that was calculated after some
 * manipulation. as a result, when importing this component "foo" to a local scope, the original
 * hash is different than the currently calculated hash.
 * in Bit version <= 14.4.3, when importing this component, you'd get the exact same error as above.
 * now, we expect the import to work with no errors and to save the version object into the
 * original hash path (6b/d019fe5dbf11a5adf2f68d0099457ad077fa8c).
