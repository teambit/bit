import { CopyBox } from './copy-box';

CopyBox copies its (string) children to the clipboard.  
It should not be used for more than a single line. For code-snippets, use the CodeSnippet component, instead.

Using the CopyBox component:

```js live
<CopyBox style={{ width: '600px' }}>npm install @teambit/documenter.ui.copy-box</CopyBox>
```
