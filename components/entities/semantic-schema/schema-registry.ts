/**
 * @deprecated Do not import SchemaRegistry from this location.
 * Import from '@teambit/schema' instead.
 *
 * This file is kept for backwards compatibility only.
 * The SchemaRegistry has been moved to the schema aspect to ensure single-instance behavior.
 *
 * @example
 * // Instead of:
 * import { SchemaRegistry } from '@teambit/semantics.entities.semantic-schema';
 *
 * // Use:
 * import { SchemaRegistry } from '@teambit/schema';
 */
export { SchemaRegistry } from '@teambit/schema';
