the current components seem to be re-created and have a different history.
to resolve this error, you'll need to recover the deleted components, re-do your changes, then tag/snap and export.
here is a step-by-step guide:
1) backup your current component to another directory.
2) run "bit recover <component-id>". it'll restore the deleted component.
3) re-do your changes on the restored component.
4) run "bit tag" or "bit snap" to create a new version of the component.
5) run "bit export" to export the new version to the remote scope.

        .join(', ')} to the remote scope.
to resolve this conflict and merge your remote and local changes, please do the following:
1) bit reset [component-pattern] [--all]
2) bit checkout head [component-pattern]
once your changes are merged with the new remote version, please tag and export a new version of the component to the remote scope.`;

        .join(', ')} to the remote scope.
to resolve this error, please re-import the above components.
if the component is up to date, run "bit status" to make sure it's not merge-pending`;
