## How to Install and Use Bit Components

- Bit Components are reusable pieces of code in the form of node packages.
- Search for Bit Components using `bit_remote_search` tool.
- Use `bit_remote_component_details` only on Bit Components to get information like package name (to use when installing, e.g. `npm install <package-name>`), APIs and documentation (to use when using in code).
- If a user is requesting functionality, you can search if there are available components that implement it using `bit_remote_search`.
- Filter my search with my account name "ACCOUNT" to find components you have created or are a maintainer of.
