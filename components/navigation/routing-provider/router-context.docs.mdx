import { RouterProvider } from './router-context';
// import { Link } from '@teambit/base-react.navigation.link';

Routing systems use different appraches to ease and improve routing. This might cause trouble tryign to use components across different application that are using
different routing system.

An example, could be a Card component, which uses a Link to direct people to a certain page. Bounding this component to the [NextJS Link](/) would prevent this component
from being used in React Router apps, execpeting the [React Router Link](/) to work properly.

## Basic usage

When routing provider is absent, the Link will a native `a` tag. Different routing implementations can be used.

```tsx
import { Link } from '@teambit/base-react.navigation.link';

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Link></Link>
    </>
  );
}
```

This way, every component can use the [Link](/) component and stay agnostic to the specific routing system in use in the host application.

### Using the link with React Router

For using `react-router`, use our routing implementation which can be found here.

```tsx
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';
import { RoutingProvider, Link } from '@teambit/base-react.navigation.link';
import { reactRouterAdapter } from '@teambit/ui-foundation.ui.navigation.react-router-adapter'; // TODO: uri to rename

export function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <RoutingProvider implementation={reactRouterAdapter}>
        <Routes>
        <Link href="/plugins">Click me!</Link> // this link won't refresh the entire page and will use the React Router link.
      </RoutingProvider>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
```

### Using with NextJS
