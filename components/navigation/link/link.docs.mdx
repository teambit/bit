import { Link } from './link';

A universal Link component that provides compatibility across React frameworks and routing systems.

Components containing non-native links fail when consumed in apps that do not use the proper routing system.
For example, a [React Router Link](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/api/Link) will fail when used in a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/navigate-between-pages/link-component) application, or even when used in a legacy version of React Router.

Link solves that by injecting a link implementation that fits its hosting routing system. If no system is defined, Link defaults to a standard anchor tag (`<a href=""></a>`).

## Basic usage

Use this generic Link instead of the concrete one provided by your routing system.
Once it is consumed in an app, wrap it with the Navigation Provider and set it with the proper router adapter (this would be the adapter that matches the routing system of the hosting app)

<LeftRight left={<MyRouterAdapterSnippet />} right={<MyRouterAdapter />} />

Fork this component to learn how to use the link component with your own router adapter:

```bash
bit fork learnbit.base-react/navigation/my-router-adapter
```

- Check the [`my-router-adapter.composition.tsx`](https://bit.dev/learnbit/base-react/navigation/my-router-adapter/~code/my-router-adapter.composition.tsx) file to learn how to use Link with a custom adapter
- Check the [`my-link.tsx`](https://bit.dev/learnbit/base-react/navigation/my-router-adapter/~code/my-link.tsx) file to learn how to create a custom Link implementation
- Check the [`my-router-adapter.tsx`](https://bit.dev/learnbit/base-react/navigation/my-router-adapter/~code/my-router-adapter.tsx) file to learn how to create a custom router adapter (that uses the above Link implementation)

## Using Link with React Router

Use Bit's [React Router Adapter](https://bit.dev/teambit/ui-foundation/ui/navigation/react-router-adapter) to have the Link components implemented as React Router Links version 6.0.0.

```tsx
import { BrowserRouter, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';
import { NavigationProvider, Link } from '@teambit/base-react.navigation.link';
import { reactRouterAdapter } from '@teambit/ui-foundation.ui.navigation.react-router-adapter';

export function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <NavigationProvider implementation={reactRouterAdapter}>
        {/* this link won't refresh the entire page, and will use the React Router link. */}
        <Link href="/plugins">Click me!</Link>

        <Routes>
          <Route path="/plugins">plugins</Route>
        </Routes>
      </NavigationProvider>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
```
